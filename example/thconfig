# This example shows how to integrate a fictive cave with therion surface grid.
#
# Prerequisite is to run the command `therionsurface2survex example/surface.th -t`
# The command will parse the surface.th grid file and outputs a surface.th.th
# therion source file containing a surface leg survey.
# Then compile this file with `therion`. This produces a test.3d file,
# containing both the survey and the surface mesh.
#

source myCave.th       # ficitve data from the survey
source surface.th.th   # exported from surface.th grid data with Option "-t"

export model -o test.3d
